Core Custom Exceptions

This module defines domain-specific exceptions used throughout the HeronAI
application. Using custom exceptions allows for more granular error handling
and clearer communication of issues compared to relying solely on built-in
Python exceptions.

Key Benefits:
- Improved Readability: Custom exception names (e.g., `MetadataProcessingError`)
  immediately convey the context of the error.
- Granular Handling: Allows specific `try...except` blocks to catch particular
  application-level errors without catching overly broad `Exception` types.
- Consistent Error Reporting: Can be integrated with global error handlers
  in the API layer to provide consistent error responses to clients.

Defined Exceptions:
- `MetadataProcessingError`: Raised when an error occurs during the metadata
  extraction or processing stage of the classification pipeline.
- `ModelNotAvailableError`: (Already defined in `src.classification.model`)
  Raised when the persisted ML model artefact cannot be loaded.
- `StageExecutionError`: Raised by classification *stage* functions when an unrecoverable error occurs.

    them from more general file I/O errors or other pipeline stage failures.

    have applied any stage-specific recovery/fallback logic.
