"""tests.unit.classification package

Holds *unit* test suites for the **classification** sub-system (confidence
aggregation, model wrappers, etc.).  The file is intentionally empty but
present so that Python treats the directory as a package â€“ useful when tests
need to perform relative imports or when external tooling relies on package
semantics.
